The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
A big black bear sat on a big black rug.
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Can you can a can as a canner can can a can?
Six slippery snails slid slowly seaward.
Red lorry, yellow lorry.
The sun sets in the west.
He threw three free throws.
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Betty bought butter, but the butter was bitter.
How now brown cow.
Fred fed Ted bread and Ted fed Fred bread.
A proper copper coffee pot.
The blue sky is clear today.
Sheena leads, Sheila needs.
This is the first time I have been here.
My voice is my passport, verify me.
I want to know the way to San Jose.
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
What time does the train leave tomorrow?
It's raining cats and dogs.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
I think, therefore I am.
The early bird catches the worm.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
All that glitters is not gold.
